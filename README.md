## Holy Al Quran
Al Quran is the holy book of Islam. Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed by Allah (SWT) to the final prophet & messenger, Muhammad Ibn Abdullah (SAW), through the archangel Zibrail (AS),  incrementally over a period of some 23 years, in the beginning month of Ramadan.

## Motive
This is one of my dream project. I hope it will help people to learn the holy Quran. I'm very gratitude to Allah (SWT) for giving me this opportunity to work a project about the Holy Quran.
